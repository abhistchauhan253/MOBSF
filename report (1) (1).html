<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.
